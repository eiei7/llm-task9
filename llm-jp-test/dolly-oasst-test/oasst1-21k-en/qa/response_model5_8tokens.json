The goal of Kriya Yoga is to attain a state of meditation and stillness, where the mind is free from thoughts and distractions, and one is able to experience a deeper connection with the divine.\n\nTo achieve the static still state in Kriya Yoga, one must follow a set of practices that involve both physical and mental discipline. Some common techniques used in Kriya Yoga include:\n\nPranayama: Controlled breathing exercises that help regulate the flow of life energy (prana) and calm the mind.\n\nAsanas: Physical postures that help prepare the body for meditation.\n\nMudras: Hand gestures that help direct energy and consciousness towards spiritual goals.\n\nMantra repetition: The repetition of a word or phrase to help focus the mind and calm the thoughts.\n\nMeditation: A state of concentrated awareness where the mind is still and focused.\n\nIt is important to note that Kriya Yoga is not just a set of techniques, but a spiritual path that involves a commitment to personal growth and the development of moral and ethical values. To achieve the static still state, one must practice regularly and with discipline, and must also strive to live a virtuous and mindful life.",
