One popular option is the \"Hello World\" Electron application which uses the `electron` package as a starting point and can be built using `webpack`. Here is an example of how to use this project template:\n\n    yarn create-app my-electron-app\n\nThis will generate a new directory called `my-electron-app` containing a file called `main.ts` in the root directory. This file should include the following code:\n\njavascript\n\nimport { app, BrowserWindow } from 'electron';\n\nfunction createWindow() {\n  const window = new BrowserWindow({\n    width: 800,\n    height: 600,\n    webPreferences: {\n      nodeIntegration: true,\n    },\n  });\n\n  window.loadFile('index.html');\n\n  window.on('closed', () => {\n    window = null;\n  });\n}\n\napp.whenReady().then(() => {\n  createWindow();\n});\n\napp.on('activate', function () {\n  if (BrowserWindow.getAllWindows().length === 0) createWindow();\n});\n```\n\nIn this example we first import the necessary packages, including the Electron package used for creating the \"Hello World\" application. We then define a function called `createWindow` that creates a new browser window with the specified parameters. In the `content` parameter we specify the index.html file that will be loaded into the new window. Finally, we register an event listener that creates the window when the main process starts up, and destroys it when the window is closed.\n\nThese are just a few examples, but there are many different starter projects available for Electron, TypeScript, and Webpack. You can find more information by looking at the official Electr",
