However, many people are not sure what items can be recycled or how to properly recycle them. In this project, we will use artificial intelligence (AI) to develop a system that can automatically identify and sort recyclable materials. The system will use image recognition technology to analyze images of waste items and determine whether they can be recycled or not. The AI will also provide feedback to users on how to properly dispose of non-recyclable items.\n\nMethodology:\n\n1. Collect and categorize images of waste items: We will collect a large dataset of images of waste items and categorize them into recyclable and non-recyclable categories.\n\n2. Train an AI model: Using machine learning techniques, we will train an AI model to recognize the different types of recyclable and non-recyclable waste items. We will use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to analyze the images and classify them into different categories.\n\n3. Develop a mobile app: We will develop a mobile app that allows users to take a picture of a waste item and get immediate feedback on whether it can be recycled or not. The app will also provide information on how to properly dispose of non-recyclable items.\n\n4. Test the system: We will test the system using a variety of waste items and evaluate its accuracy and effectiveness.\n\nExpected Outcome: The proposed system has the potential to revolutionize recycling practices by providing an easy-to-use and accessible tool for identifying and sorting recyclable materials. It could also help to increase public awareness about recycling and encourage more people to adopt sustainable waste disposal practices.\n\nThis project combines elements of computer science, machine learning, and environmental science, and would be a great fit for a national competition about science and technology.",

        "candidate": "\"Fooled by Randomness\" i A Brief Summary of the Book\n\nThe book “Fooled by Randomness” by Nassim Nicholas Taleb is a thought-provoking examination of how we are often blinded to the role of chance in our lives and in life generally. The author argues that while it may not seem like it, randomness plays an important role in many aspects of our lives and decisions. For example, weather patterns can be influenced by chance atmospheric conditions, and even seemingly random events such as the flip of a coin can have significant consequences.\n\nIn the book, Taleb uses examples from various fields, including finance, science, art, and human behavior, to demonstrate how randomness can lead to both success and failure. He argues that people tend to underestimate the role of chance in their lives because they are overly familiar with the outcomes of certain situations and overestimate the role of skill and intelligence in determining success or failure.\n\nTaleb also discusses the concept of luck, which he defines as the difference between what happens and what would have happened had things been different. He argues that luck is an essential part of life and that without it, nothing truly meaningful could ever happen. In addition, he suggests that individuals should be more aware of their luck and use this knowledge to make better choices and pursue goals that are meaningful rather than ones driven by external forces.\n\nOverall, \"Fooled by Randomness\" is a challenging but insightful read that challenges readers to think about the role of chance and to approach life with an open mind. It provides an interesting perspective on how randomness can shape our lives and impact our decisions.",

Choose \"When a new response is submitted\" as the trigger for the flow.\n4. Add an action \"Get response details.\" This will retrieve the data from the form submission.\n5. Add an action \"Update a row.\" Choose the Excel workbook and worksheet that you want to update.\n6. Map the form fields to the Excel columns, including the field that you want to use to populate different tabs.\n7. Add a condition to determine which tab to populate based on the value of the field you selected. For example, if the field is \"Department,\" you can create separate conditions for each department and add actions to update the corresponding worksheet.\n8. Save the flow and test it by submitting a response to the form.\n\nThat's it! The flow will now automatically populate the Excel sheet with the form data, with different tabs based on the value of the selected field.",
